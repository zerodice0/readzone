## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of ReadZone seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Create a Public Issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Send a Private Report

Instead, please send an email to security@readzone.com with the following information:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue**
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue**
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of your report
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates on the progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical security issues within 7 days

### 4. Coordinated Disclosure

We practice coordinated disclosure:

1. You report the vulnerability privately
2. We work together to understand and resolve the issue
3. We release a fix
4. We publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## Security Measures

### Application Security

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure token storage
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Strong password requirements enforced
- Account lockout after failed login attempts
- Session management with automatic timeout

#### Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- SQL injection prevention using Prisma ORM
- XSS protection with output encoding
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- File upload restrictions and virus scanning

#### Data Protection
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt with salt
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Data transmission over HTTPS only
- Personal data minimization principles
- Secure data deletion procedures

#### API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- API key authentication for external integrations
- Request/response logging for audit trails
- Input size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- Comprehensive error handling without information leakage

### Infrastructure Security

#### Docker Security
- Non-root user execution in containers
- Multi-stage builds to minimize attack surface
- Regular base image updates
- Security scanning of container images
- Resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion

#### Network Security
- Network segmentation with Docker networks
- Firewall rules restricting unnecessary access
- SSL/TLS encryption for all communications
- Regular security updates and patches
- Intrusion detection and monitoring

#### Database Security
- Database access controls and permissions
- Regular database backups with encryption
- Connection string security and rotation
- Database activity monitoring
- Principle of least privilege access

### Development Security

#### Secure Development Lifecycle
- Security requirements in development process
- Threat modeling for new features
- Security code reviews for all changes
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

#### Dependency Management
- Regular dependency updates and security patches
- Automated vulnerability scanning with Dependabot
- License compliance checking
- Supply chain security best practices
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation

#### CI/CD Security
- Secure CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Secrets management with environment variables
- Container image scanning in pipeline
- Security testing automation
- Deployment approval processes

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Controls

#### Headers & Middleware
```typescript
// Security headers
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: true,
  hsts: true,
  noSniff: true,
  xssFilter: true
}));

// Rate limiting
app.use('/api/auth', authRateLimit);
app.use('/api', generalRateLimit);

// Input sanitization
app.use(sanitizeInput);
```

#### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Password strength validation
const { isValid, message } = validatePasswordStrength(password);

// Secure token generation
const token = jwt.sign(payload, JWT_SECRET, {
  expiresIn: '15m',
  issuer: 'readzone',
  audience: 'readzone-users'
});
```

#### Database Security
```typescript
// Parameterized queries via Prisma
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { email: validatedEmail }
});

// No raw SQL queries exposed
```

### Security Monitoring

#### Logging & Alerting
- Security event logging with structured logs
- Real-time alerting for suspicious activities
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Rate limit violation tracking
- Error rate monitoring and alerting

#### Metrics & Monitoring
- Authentication success/failure rates
- API endpoint response times and error rates
- Database query performance monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking
- Security scan results trending
